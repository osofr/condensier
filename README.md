### Installation

To install the development version of `condensier` (requires the `devtools` package):

```R
devtools::install_github('osofr/condensier', build_vignettes = FALSE)
```


### Instructions

Simulate some data with continuous outcome ("sA"):

```R
library("simcausal")
D <- DAG.empty()
D <-
D + node("W1", distr = "rbern", prob = 0.5) +
  node("W2", distr = "rbern", prob = 0.3) +
  node("W3", distr = "rbern", prob = 0.3) +
  node("sA.mu", distr = "rconst", const = (0.98 * W1 + 0.58 * W2 + 0.33 * W3)) +
  node("sA", distr = "rnorm", mean = sA.mu, sd = 1)
D <- set.DAG(D, n.test = 10)
datO <- sim(D, n = 10000, rndseed = 12345)
```

Fit conditional density using equal mass bins (same number of obs per bin):

```R
library("condensier")
dens_fit <- fit_density(
    X = c("W1", "W2", "W3"), 
    Y = "sA", 
    input_data = datO, 
    nbins = 20, 
    bin.method = "equal.mass",
    bin_estimator = speedglmR6$new())
```

Wrapper function to predict the conditional probability (likelihood) for new observations:

```R
newdata <- datO[1:5, c("W1", "W2", "W3", "sA"), with = FALSE]
preds <- predict_probability(dens_fit, newdata)
```

Wrapper function to sample the values from the conditional density fit:
```R
sampledY <- sample_value(dens_fit, newdata)
```
