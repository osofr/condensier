\title{Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Network Data}
\description{
The \pkg{tmlenet} R package implements the Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) of causal effects
 under single time point stochastic interventions in network data.
 The package also implements the Horvitz-Thompson estimator for networks (IPTW) and the parametric g-computation formula estimator.
 The inference for the TMLE is based on its asymptotic normality and the efficient influence curve for dependent data.
 The inference for IPTW is based on its corresponding influence curve for dependent data.

\details{
The input data structure consists of rows of unit-specific observations, with each row \code{i} represented by random variables
 (\code{F.i},\code{W.i},\code{A.i},\code{Y.i}), where \code{F.i} is a vector of "\emph{friend IDs}" of unit \code{i}
 (also referred to as \code{i}'s "\emph{network}"), \code{W.i} is a vector of \code{i}'s baseline covariates, \code{A.i} is \code{i}'s exposure
 (either binary, categorical or continuous) and \code{Y.i} is \code{i}'s binary outcome.
 Each exposure \code{A.i} depends on (possibly multivariate) baseline summary measure(s) \code{sW.i}, where \code{sW.i}
 can be any user-specified function of \code{i}'s baseline covariates \code{W.i} and the baseline covariates of \code{i}'s friends in
 set \code{F.i} (all \code{W.j} such that \code{j} is in \code{F.i}).
 Similarly, each outcome \code{Y.i} depends on \code{sW.i} and (possibly multivariate) summary measure(s) \code{sA.i},
 where \code{sA.i} can be any user-specified function of \code{i}'s baseline covariates and exposure (\code{W.i},\code{A.i}) and the
 baseline covariates and exposures of \code{i}'s friends (all \code{W.j},\code{A.j} such that \code{j} is in \code{i}'s friend set \code{F.i}).

The summary measures (\code{sW.i},\code{sA.i}) are defined simultaneously for all \code{i} with functions
 \code{\link{def_sW}} and \code{\link{def_sA}}.
 It is assumed that (\code{sW.i},\code{sA.i}) have the same dimensionality across \code{i}. The function \code{\link{eval.summaries}}
 can be used for evaluating these summary measures. All estimation is performed by calling the \code{\link{tmlenet}} function.
 The vector of friends \code{F.i} can be specified either as a single column \code{NETIDnode} in the input data (where each \code{F.i} is a string
 of friend IDs or friend row numbers delimited by the character separator \code{sep}) or as a separate input matrix \code{NETIDmat} of network IDs
 (where each row is a vector of friend IDs or friend row numbers).
 Specifying the network as a matrix generally results in significant improvements to run time.

\section{Routines}{

The following routines will be generally invoked, in the same order as presented below.
\describe{

\item{\code{\link{def_sW}}}{This is the first part of the two part specification of the structural equation model
   for the outcome \code{Y}.
   Defines the (multivariate) baseline-covariate-based summary measure functions
   that will be later applied to the input data to derive the (multivariate) summary measures \code{sW}.
   Each component \code{sW[j]} of \code{sW} is defined by an R expression that takes as its input
   unit's baseline covariates and the baseline covariates of unit's friends.
   Each argument passed to \code{def_sW} is considered a separate summary measure, with the \code{j}th argument
   defining the \code{j}the summary measure \code{sW[j]} and the name of the \code{j}th argument defining the name
   of the summary measure \code{sW[j]}.
   The arguments of \code{def_sW} can be either named, unnamed or a mixture of both. When the argument \code{j} is unnamed,
   the summary measure name for \code{sW[j]} is created automatically.

   Each summary measure is defined either by an evaluable R expressions or by a string containing an evaluable R
   expression.
   These expressions can use a special double-square-bracket subsetting operator \code{"Var[[index]]"}, which enables
   referencing the variable \code{Var} values of unit's friends.
   For example,
   \code{Var[[1]]} will evaluate to a one-dimensional vector of summary measures of length \code{nrow(data)}, where for each
   row from the input \code{data},
   this summary measure will contain the \code{Var} value of the unit's first friend. The ordering of friends is
   determined by the ordering of friend IDs specified in the network input.
   In cases when the unit doesn't have any friends, its corresponding value of \code{Var[[1]]} will evaluate
   to \code{NA} by default. However, all such \code{NA}'s can be replaced by 0's by passing \code{replaceNAw0 = TRUE}
   as an additional argument to \code{def_sW}.
   One can also use vectors for indexing friend variable \code{Var} values in \code{Var[[index]]}.
   For example, \code{Var[[1:Kmax]]} will evaluate to a \code{Kmax}-dimensional summary measure, which will be a matrix
   with \code{nrow(data)} rows and \code{Kmax} columns,
   where the first column will evaluate to \code{Var[[1]]}, the second to \code{Var[[2]]}, and so on,
   up to the last column evaluating to \code{Var[[Kmax]]}.
   Note that \code{Kmax} is a special reserved constant that can be used inside the network indexing operators.
   It is set to the highest number of friends among all units in the input \code{data} and it is specified by
   the user input argument \code{Kmax}. See \code{def_sW} manual for various examples of
   summary measures that use the network indexing operators.}

\item{\code{\link{def_sA}}}{Defines treatment summary measures \code{sA} that can be functions of each unit's exposure & baseline covariates,
   as well the exposures and baseline covariates of unit's friends.
   This is the second part of the two part specification of the structural equation model for the outcome \code{Y}.
   The syntax is identical to \code{def_sW} function, except that \code{def_sA} can consists of functions of baseline covariates
   as well as the exposure \code{Anode}.}

\item{\code{\link{eval.summaries}}}{A convenience function that can be used for validating and evaluating the user-specified summary measures.
   Takes the input dataset and evaluates the summary measures based on objects previously defined with function calls \code{def_sW} and \code{def_sA}.
   Note that this function is called automatically by the \code{tmlenet} function and does not need to be called by the user prior to calling \code{tmlenet}.}

\item{\code{\link{tmlenet}}}{Performs estimation of the causal effect of interest using the observed input \code{data},
   the intervention of interest, the network information and the previously defined summary measures \code{sW}, \code{sA}.}
