> Fit a conditional density `f(A|W)`, where `A` can be continuous and multivariate and `W` is set of predictors.
> This estimator breaks up the support of a continuous `A` into discrete bins and fits the conditional hazard for each bin. By default the logistic regression will be used for fitting each bin hazard. Alternatively, arbitrary machine learning algorithms can be used via learners available in `sl3` R package (see example below).
> Given several competing candidate density estimators, one can find the optimal convex combination these candidate estimators by using Super Learner [`sl3`].
> For detailed description of the estimator implemented in this package see `r AutoCite(bib, "diaz2011super")` and `r AutoCite(bib, "munoz2012population")`.

### Installation

To install the development version of `condensier` (requires the `devtools` package):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('osofr/condensier', build_vignettes = FALSE)
```


### Instructions

Simulate some data with continuous outcome (`"sA"`):

```{r}
library("simcausal")
D <- DAG.empty()
D <-
D + node("W1", distr = "rbern", prob = 0.5) +
  node("W2", distr = "rbern", prob = 0.3) +
  node("W3", distr = "rbern", prob = 0.3) +
  node("sA.mu", distr = "rconst", const = (0.98 * W1 + 0.58 * W2 + 0.33 * W3)) +
  node("sA", distr = "rnorm", mean = sA.mu, sd = 1)
D <- set.DAG(D, n.test = 10)
datO <- sim(D, n = 10000, rndseed = 12345)
```

Fit conditional density using equal mass bins (same number of observations per bin):

```{r}
library("condensier")
dens_fit <- fit_density(
    X = c("W1", "W2", "W3"), 
    Y = "sA", 
    input_data = datO, 
    nbins = 20, 
    bin_method = "equal.mass",
    bin_estimator = speedglmR6$new())
```

Wrapper function to predict the conditional probability (likelihood) for new observations:

```{r}
newdata <- datO[1:5, c("W1", "W2", "W3", "sA"), with = FALSE]
preds <- predict_probability(dens_fit, newdata)
```

Wrapper function to sample the values from the conditional density fit:

```{r}
sampledY <- sample_value(dens_fit, newdata)
```

Fit conditional density using custom bin definitions (argument `intrvls`):

```{r}
dens_fit <- fit_density(
    X = c("W1", "W2", "W3"),
    Y = "sA",
    input_data = datO,
    bin_estimator = speedglmR6$new(),
    intrvls = list(sA = seq(-4,4, by = 0.1)))
```

Fit conditional density using custom bin definitions and
pool all bin indicators into a single long-format dataset.
The pooling results in a single regression that is fit for all bin hazards,
with a bin indicator added as an additional covariate.

```{r}
dens_fit <- fit_density(
    X = c("W1", "W2", "W3"),
    Y = "sA",
    input_data = datO,
    bin_estimator = speedglmR6$new(),
    intrvls = list(sA = seq(-4,4, by = 0.1)),
    pool = TRUE)
```

### Fitting Super Learner density with `sl3` package

Any binary-outcome regression learner available in `sl3` package can be used as a "drop-in" learner for conditional bin hazard. Below, we use `xgboost` R package to define a new estimator of the bin hazard. Note that below, we are setting the tuning parameter `pool` to `TRUE`. This will have an effect of "pooling" all discrete bin indicators into a single dataset (with bin number added as a new covariate). This is followed by a single regression fit that is performed for all bins simultaneously (hence saving a lot of computation time and allowing the algorithm to perform smoothing over the bins).

```{r}
library("sl3")

task <- sl3_Task$new(datO, covariates=c("W1", "W2", "W3"), outcome="sA")
lrn <- Lrnr_condensier$new(nbins = 10, bin_method = "equal.len", pool = TRUE, 
  bin_estimator = Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 5, objective = "reg:logistic"))

trained_lrn = lrn$train(task)

newdata <- datO[1:5, c("W1", "W2", "W3", "sA")]
new_task <- sl3_Task$new(newdata, covariates=c("W1", "W2", "W3"),outcome="sA" )
pred_probs = trained_lrn$predict(new_task)
pred_probs
```

Now that we have defined the candidate bin hazard estimator, it is time to train the model and obtained predictions (likelihood) based on new observations

```{r}
trained_lrn = lrn$train(task)

newdata <- datO[1:5, c("W1", "W2", "W3", "sA")]
new_task <- sl3_Task$new(newdata, covariates=c("W1", "W2", "W3"),outcome="sA" )
pred_probs = trained_lrn$predict(new_task)
pred_probs
```

Finally, multiple candidate density estimators can be optimally stacked or combined with a Super Learner. The convex combination of the candidates is found by minimizing the cross-validated negative loglikelihood loss function. In this example we define 3 candidate density learners:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lrn1 <- Lrnr_condensier$new(nbins = 25, bin_method = "equal.len", pool = TRUE, 
  bin_estimator = Lrnr_glm_fast$new(family = "binomial"))
lrn2 <- Lrnr_condensier$new(nbins = 20, bin_method = "equal.mass", pool = TRUE,
  bin_estimator = Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 50, objective = "reg:logistic"))
lrn3 <- Lrnr_condensier$new(nbins = 35, bin_method = "equal.len", pool = TRUE,
  bin_estimator = Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 50, objective = "reg:logistic"))
```

We proceed by training the Super Learner (with 10 fold cross-validation) and then finding the optimal convex combination of the candidate densities with the meta-learner `Lrnr_solnp_density`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sl <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = list(lrn1, lrn2, lrn3),
                  metalearner = Lrnr_solnp_density$new())
sl_fit <- sl$train(task)
```

To predict for new data, wrap the desired dataset into an `sl3-task` object and call predict on above `sl_fit` object:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
newdata <- datO[1:5, c("W1", "W2", "W3", "sA")]
new_task <- sl3_Task$new(newdata, covariates=c("W1", "W2", "W3"),outcome="sA" )
sl_fit$predict(new_task)
```


### Nesting the Super Learner for bin hazards with density Super Learner

Note that `bin_estimator` can be also a Super-Learner object from `sl3`. In this case the bin hazard will be estimated by stacking several candidate estimators. For example, below, we define a single density learner `lrn`,  with the hazard estimator defined by the Super-Learner that stacks two candidates (GLM and `xgboost` GBM). Note that in contrast to the above example, this Super-Learner fit will be optimized for the logistic regression problem (estimating pooled bin hazards), but still using internal 10-fold cross-validation. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("sl3")
lrn <- Lrnr_condensier$new(nbins = 35, bin_method = "equal.len", pool = TRUE, bin_estimator = 
  Lrnr_sl$new(
    learners = list(
      Lrnr_glm_fast$new(family = "binomial"),
      Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 50, objective = "reg:logistic")
      ),
    metalearner = Lrnr_glm$new()
    ))
binSL_fit <- lrn$train(task)
```

In prinicple, one can nest the two of the above described types of Super Learners: the Super Learner that fits the bin hazard of each candidate density and the Super Learner that finds the optimal combination of the candidate densities. However, due to potential performance constraints, we currently advise against that. 

### Stacking and cross-validating candidate densities with `sl3` package

One can build a custom version of their own Super Learner by using the stacking and cross-validation procedures availabe in `sl3`. Here we define a stack of 3 learners, then train all 3 and predict for new data (likelihood):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
learner_stack <- Stack$new(lrn1, lrn2, lrn3)
stack_fit <- learner_stack$train(task)
preds <- stack_fit$predict(new_task)
```

Here we cross-validate all 3 learners in the stack, using the default 10-fold CV:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cv_stack <- Lrnr_cv$new(learner_stack)
cv_fit <- cv_stack$train(task)
```
