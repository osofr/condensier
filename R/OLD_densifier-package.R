#' Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Network Data
#'
#' The \pkg{tmlenet} R package implements the Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) of causal effects
#'  under single time point stochastic interventions in network data.
#'  The package also implements the Horvitz-Thompson estimator for networks (IPTW) and the parametric g-computation formula estimator.
#'  The inference for the TMLE is based on its asymptotic normality and the efficient influence curve for dependent data.
#'  The inference for IPTW is based on its corresponding influence curve for dependent data.
#'
#' The input data structure consists of rows of unit-specific observations, with each row \code{i} represented by random variables
#'  (\code{F.i},\code{W.i},\code{A.i},\code{Y.i}), where \code{F.i} is a vector of "\emph{friend IDs}" of unit \code{i}
#'  (also referred to as \code{i}'s "\emph{network}"), \code{W.i} is a vector of \code{i}'s baseline covariates, \code{A.i} is \code{i}'s exposure
#'  (either binary, categorical or continuous) and \code{Y.i} is \code{i}'s binary outcome.
#'  Each exposure \code{A.i} depends on (possibly multivariate) baseline summary measure(s) \code{sW.i}, where \code{sW.i}
#'  can be any user-specified function of \code{i}'s baseline covariates \code{W.i} and the baseline covariates of \code{i}'s friends in
#'  set \code{F.i} (all \code{W.j} such that \code{j} is in \code{F.i}).
#'  Similarly, each outcome \code{Y.i} depends on \code{sW.i} and (possibly multivariate) summary measure(s) \code{sA.i},
#'  where \code{sA.i} can be any user-specified function of \code{i}'s baseline covariates and exposure (\code{W.i},\code{A.i}) and the
#'  baseline covariates and exposures of \code{i}'s friends (all \code{W.j},\code{A.j} such that \code{j} is in \code{i}'s friend set \code{F.i}).
#'
#' The summary measures (\code{sW.i},\code{sA.i}) are defined simultaneously for all \code{i} with functions
#'  \code{\link{def_sW}} and \code{\link{def_sA}}.
#'  It is assumed that (\code{sW.i},\code{sA.i}) have the same dimensionality across \code{i}. The function \code{\link{eval.summaries}}
#'  can be used for evaluating these summary measures. All estimation is performed by calling the \code{\link{tmlenet}} function.
#'  The vector of friends \code{F.i} can be specified either as a single column \code{NETIDnode} in the input data (where each \code{F.i} is a string
#'  of friend IDs or friend row numbers delimited by the character separator \code{sep}) or as a separate input matrix \code{NETIDmat} of network IDs
#'  (where each row is a vector of friend IDs or friend row numbers).
#'  Specifying the network as a matrix generally results in significant improvements to run time.

#' @section Routines:
#' The following routines will be generally invoked, in the same order as presented below.
#' \describe{
#'
#' \item{\code{\link{def_sW}}}{This is the first part of the two part specification of the structural equation model
#'    for the outcome \code{Y}.
#'    Defines the (multivariate) baseline-covariate-based summary measure functions
#'    that will be later applied to the input data to derive the (multivariate) summary measures \code{sW}.
#'    Each component \code{sW[j]} of \code{sW} is defined by an R expression that takes as its input
#'    unit's baseline covariates and the baseline covariates of unit's friends.
#'    Each argument passed to \code{def_sW} is considered a separate summary measure, with the \code{j}th argument
#'    defining the \code{j}the summary measure \code{sW[j]} and the name of the \code{j}th argument defining the name
#'    of the summary measure \code{sW[j]}.
#'    The arguments of \code{def_sW} can be either named, unnamed or a mixture of both. When the argument \code{j} is unnamed,
#'    the summary measure name for \code{sW[j]} is created automatically.
#'
#'    Each summary measure is defined either by an evaluable R expressions or by a string containing an evaluable R
#'    expression.
#'    These expressions can use a special double-square-bracket subsetting operator \code{"Var[[index]]"}, which enables
#'    referencing the variable \code{Var} values of unit's friends.
#'    For example,
#'    \code{Var[[1]]} will evaluate to a one-dimensional vector of summary measures of length \code{nrow(data)}, where for each
#'    row from the input \code{data},
#'    this summary measure will contain the \code{Var} value of the unit's first friend. The ordering of friends is
#'    determined by the ordering of friend IDs specified in the network input.
#'    In cases when the unit doesn't have any friends, its corresponding value of \code{Var[[1]]} will evaluate
#'    to \code{NA} by default. However, all such \code{NA}'s can be replaced by 0's by passing \code{replaceNAw0 = TRUE}
#'    as an additional argument to \code{def_sW}.
#'    One can also use vectors for indexing friend variable \code{Var} values in \code{Var[[index]]}.
#'    For example, \code{Var[[1:Kmax]]} will evaluate to a \code{Kmax}-dimensional summary measure, which will be a matrix
#'    with \code{nrow(data)} rows and \code{Kmax} columns,
#'    where the first column will evaluate to \code{Var[[1]]}, the second to \code{Var[[2]]}, and so on,
#'    up to the last column evaluating to \code{Var[[Kmax]]}.
#'    Note that \code{Kmax} is a special reserved constant that can be used inside the network indexing operators.
#'    It is set to the highest number of friends among all units in the input \code{data} and it is specified by
#'    the user input argument \code{Kmax}. See \code{def_sW} manual for various examples of
#'    summary measures that use the network indexing operators.}
#'
#' \item{\code{\link{def_sA}}}{Defines treatment summary measures \code{sA} that can be functions of each unit's exposure & baseline covariates,
#'    as well the exposures and baseline covariates of unit's friends.
#'    This is the second part of the two part specification of the structural equation model for the outcome \code{Y}.
#'    The syntax is identical to \code{def_sW} function, except that \code{def_sA} can consists of functions of baseline covariates
#'    as well as the exposure \code{Anode}.}
#'
#' \item{\code{\link{eval.summaries}}}{A convenience function that can be used for validating and evaluating the user-specified summary measures.
#'    Takes the input dataset and evaluates the summary measures based on objects previously defined with function calls \code{def_sW} and \code{def_sA}.
#'    Note that this function is called automatically by the \code{tmlenet} function and does not need to be called by the user prior to calling \code{tmlenet}.}
#'
#' \item{\code{\link{tmlenet}}}{Performs estimation of the causal effect of interest using the observed input \code{data},
#'    the intervention of interest, the network information and the previously defined summary measures \code{sW}, \code{sA}.}

#' An example of a network ID matrix
#'
#' This matrix demonstrates an internal data structure of how \code{tmlenet} stores the input network.
#' The network in this matrix is derived from the column \code{"Net_str"} of the dataset \code{df_netKmax6}.
#' Both, this matrix and the vector of strings in column \code{"Net_str"}, represent the same network and both can be used
#' for specifying the input network to \code{tmlenet} function.
#' The network matrix may be specified by using the argument \code{NETIDmat} of the \code{tmlenet} function.
#' Inputing the network via this type of a matrix may lead to significant reduction in total run time,
#' since any network specified as a vector of strings, such as in column "Net_str",
#' will be first converted to this type of matrix representation.
#'
#' See below and Example 3 in \code{tmlenet} help file for examples constructing this matrix from the initial network input in
#' column \code{"Net_str"} of \code{df_netKmax6}.
#'
#' This matrix consists of \code{1000} rows and \code{6} columns. Each row \code{i} encodes a vector of network IDs of observation \code{i} in
#' \code{df_netKmax6}, i.e.,
#' \code{NetInd_mat_Kmax6[,i]} contains a vector of observation row numbers in \code{df_netKmax6} that are presumed "connected to" (or "friends of")
#' observation \code{i}. Each observation can have at most 6 friends and if an observation \code{i} has fewer than 6 friends the remainder row
#' of \code{NetInd_mat_Kmax6[,i]} is filled with \code{NA}s.
